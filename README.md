This repository serves as a **template** for building front-end applications using the Snap Camera Kit for Web. It provides essential features to help developers integrate Snap Lens effects into their projects effortlessly.

## Features

- **Recording Feature**: Users can record videos showcasing Snap Lens effects by simply pressing a button.
- **Share & Download**: After processing the video, users can:
  - **Share**: Easily share the video to any social media app on their phone.
  - **Download**: Save the video locally for future use.

## Getting Started

To use this template, clone the repository and follow the instructions below to customize it for your needs.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.
- **npm**: Comes bundled with Node.js, but verify it is installed by running:
  ```
  npm -v
  ```
- **Webpack**: This repository uses Webpack as the module bundler.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/snap-camera-kit-template.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd snap-camera-kit-template
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Local Testing

To test the project locally:

1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```
   This will launch a local server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8080`. Open the URL in your browser to test the application.
   
2. Make changes to the code, and the server will automatically reload the app to reflect your updates.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:
```
npm run build
```
The optimized output will be stored in the `dist` directory, ready for deployment.

## Usage
